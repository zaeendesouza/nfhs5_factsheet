# NFHS-5 India Factsheets (Phase-I)

Data pulled from the latest NFHS-5 State factsheets from the phase-1 release. Contains the full list of indicators. Have checked it, and the data seems correct - let me know if anything is wrong.

**Note:** *A&N Islands not included yet - it got pasred with mistakes. Will update in a day or two. Also, some of the indicators have their footnote number at the end of the sentence - you'll need to clean this. Will eventually get to that, but for now, it is what it is* :slightly_frowning_face:
